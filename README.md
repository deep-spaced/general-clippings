## Typewriter Clippings

**Required:**

* [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)
* Ability to comprehend incomprehensible code.

These are clippings we've used for fun stuff like video, slideshows, etc. Amazing, ain't it?

If you want these to be available universally in BBEdit, check out the repo as Universal Items in the Clippings folder.
